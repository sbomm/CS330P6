                        <h2>The Pleasel</h2>
                        <p>This was a project designed for a Northwestern class "Design Thinking and Communication II". 
                            We were given a problem from the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab. Our client was an art therapist who
                            worked with spinal cord injury patients who were paralyzed from the neck down. An activity
                            that she often had them do was mouth painting, where the paintbrush was held in the user's mouth.
                            The problem our client had with their current setup was that it didn't give the user any 
                            independece when painting; the therapisty had to be there for every step, such as washing a 
                            paint brush, adding new colors to the paint brush, and switching brushes. Our solution utilized
                            a foldable easel set up that was convered in a metal, magnetic backing. The magnetism allowed
                            various attachments to be used to give the user independence. Attachments that we 3D-printed included
                            a vertical palette, a foldable cup holder, and a foldable paint brush holder. This set up allows the user
                            to use the entire easel on their own once setup.</p>

                        <h2>The Grippy Ramp</h2>
                        <p>This was a project designed for a Northwestern class "Design Thinking and Communication". 
                            We were given a problem from the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab. Our user was an 11-year-old 
                            child with Distal Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which meant she had control over her upper body 
                            and limited control of her lower body and used a wheelchair. Our problem was that our user wanted to 
                            have the ability to get in and out of her wheelchair independently. Our solution was the Grippy Ramp!
                            The Grippy Ramp is a low inclined ramp covered in rubber with ridges along it to give our user places
                            to place her hands. There is also a small bridge at the top to cover the gap over her footholds on her wheelchair.
                            Once setup, this allowed our user to get in and out her wheelchair all on her own. The entire ramp is also collapsable
                            and can be stored in a narrow space. Our design won the Award for Best Design at our end of quarter expo!
